hccdsim: a simulator for longitudinal health care claims data (HCCD)
--------------------------------------------------------

`hccdsim` is a `R` simulator for longitudinal health care claims data. It can be used for simulating large numbers of patients, 
observed over many time points. The package leans heavily on  `R`'s functional programming aspect and makes it easy to specify complex relationships between drug exposures and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which can depend on numerous aspects of the patients (sex, age, region etc.).
